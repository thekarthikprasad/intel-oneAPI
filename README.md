## A Brief of the Prototype:
  Our solution powers to user prompts to tailor user prompt specific recommendaion of github repos. The user prompt is modeled as keyword by an llm, based on keyword,
  we search github through github API. Narrowing down the results for user requirements, we further, take the result repositors and construct a knowledge base for a RAG model, the user prompt is given as input to the rag
  the model finds the nearest repo. LLamaIndex is used for this case.
  
## Tech Stack: 
   - Langchain
   - LLamaIndex
   
## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  - clone the repo
  - run the ipynb file
  - enter prompt
  
## What I Learned:
   - Prompt engineering
   - RAG
   - Intel Developer Tools
